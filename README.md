# jukectl

a lean utility that uses `mpd` as the Database and Player to be your own private jukebox üîäüöÄ

a "Tag" is nothing more than a Key/Value store and a Playlist is nothing more than a Key (Playlist Name) and a set of Values (Files).

## usage

I run it via Docker, an example `docker-compose.yaml` has been provided. batteries not included. üå©Ô∏è

the JSON API is **extremely** lean and also Highly Opinionated. I've written a colorful helper CLI to interact with the daemon based on my daily needs.

## history

what you are seeing here is actually the 3rd or 4th iteration of an idea, where each copy became progressively simpler and simpler.

* the first design was a fully fledged RubyOnRails app with Scaffolding and HTML and data stored in MySQL; the works.
* * but Rails got slow so ... (`n+1` template bugs mainly)
* * I have memories of trying JRuby and even being excited that the JVM offered me an all-in-one packaging solution that Rails did not...
    
* I decided to try my hand in Sinatra, still using ActiveRecord and an entire Database and HTML templates.
* * but development was still slow; often because I needed to make _entire_ HTML templates where a small JSON response would do
* * and I had lots of bugs and complexity related to Database State differening from MPD's database.

I think there were some other experiments along the way, lost to time and the fog of memory.

eventually I was struck by an idea to make it even leaner; leaner than I'd ever thought possible! üßô

* Sinatra
* * with JSON input and output only!
* * no Database, only MPD as the backend!

under the hood, a `Tag` is just a `.m3u` playlist that MPD reads and `jukectl` can do the Set() operations in-memory :)

since the switch over to Sinatra+JSON+mpd-as-database, `jukectl` has served me dutifully on a near daily basis for years now :)
